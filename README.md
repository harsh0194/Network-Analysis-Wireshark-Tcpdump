Wireshark Lab:

1)Started a packet capture on an ethernet port and saved it to file.

2)Used a display filter to detect HTTPS packets.

3)Visited a web page and detect its IP address using a display filter.

4)Located all HTTPS packets from a capture not containing a certain IP address.


Wireshark Lab: Network Security Analysis

•Using Wireshark and most of its functionalities: Captured some Network traffic that is flowing through machine and analyzing captured network traffic by opening a stored capture file.

•Generated and captured RADIUS Traffic, analyzed and viewed it in Wireshark. Knowing what the RADIUS Architecture consists of and decrypting the encrypted password using Wireshark.

•Knowing the basics about HTTP and knowing the difference between Wireshark’s Filters. Connected to an HTTP Server and initiated a Basic HTTP Authentication and capturing its Traffic on Wireshark.

•Initiated an HTTP Form-based authentication, captured it in Wireshark and analyzed it so you can see the username and password clearly. Also Captured DNS Traffic.

•Knowing how Telnet works, starting a Telnet Session with a remote Device using Powershell, captured its traffic in Wireshark and analyzing it from the Security perspective.

•Opening a SSH Session, captured the traffic and compared it with Telnet’s.

•Generated and captured HTTPS Traffic, also decrypted captured HTTPS Traffic in Wireshark.
